## Copyright & License

GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

Affero GPL means that you're not allowed to use this web server on the web unless you release the source code for your application. This is a restrictive license which has the purpose of defending Open Source work and its creators.

To be able to use the server fully without disclosing the source code, under the same license but without the need to release the source code, you have to join [neoluddite.dev](https://neoluddite.dev): an _Open Source_ package reward scheme, and obtain an API key required for production use. Every time you invoke certain functionality in a package somebody has written (e.g., `koa-static` for static files, `koa-session` for creation of session), via _Idio_, your usage will be counted and your balance in _Ludds_ on the neoluddite server will be transferred to the software engineer as a reward for his/her intellectual work. Contact license@neoluddite.dev for any requests.

> At the moment, `NeoLuddite.Dev` is in demo, and you only need to register with the service to start tracking usage. You receive 1m _Ludds_ each month and an ability to track middleware usage by multiple web applications. In future, neo luddites will assign the reward they want for usage events of their packages.

All original work on middleware and Koa are under MIT license. See [Goa Page](https://github.com/idiocc/goa/) for the list of packages and modules used in compilation of the Goa server, and the [`package.json`](/package.json) file for dependencies of this project (todo: create wiki page w/ licenses table).
