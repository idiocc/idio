<md2html>The session data is encrypted with `base64` and signed by default, unless the `.signed` option is set to false. Signing means that the signature will contain the hash which will be validated server-side, to ensure that the session data was not modified by the client. The default algorithm for signing is `sha1`, but it can be easily changed to a more secure `sha512`.</md2html>
