## WebSocket

We've implemented a library to upgrade requests into _WebSocket_ connections. You can read more at the actual [package page](https://github.com/idiocc/websocket). _Idio_ simply exports this method via its API. You need to configure it yourself.

%EXAMPLE: ./, ../../compile => @idio/idio%
