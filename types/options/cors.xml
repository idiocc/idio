      The origin or an array of origins to accept as valid.
      - In case of an array, the origin from the request headers will be searched in the array, and if found, it will be returned (since browsers only support a single `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header).
      - If a function is passed, it should return the string with the origin to set.
      - If not passed, the request origin is returned, allowing any origin to access the resource (use with caution).

    <prop boolean name="use" default="false">
      Use this middleware for every request.
